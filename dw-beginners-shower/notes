Data Warehousing for Dumm^WFairly Intelligent Beginners

Everyone's beginner database class talks about foreign keys, primary keys, natural keys, surrogate keys, normal forms, etc.
"Normal forms are good!!1 Natural keys are good!!1 Surrogate keys are mostly bad!!1"
All these Articles of Faith assume one underlying truth, namely that you're making what's called an OLTP database
There are, of course, other kinds of databases (document dbs, time series DBs, streaming dbs, etc.). Each differs in purpose and design; each one has different rules of thumb.

In addition to dwbasics talk, querying tools should be listed as a difference between OLTP and OLAP
