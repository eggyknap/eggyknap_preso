        <h2>Why are you here?</h2>
        What possessed you to show up on a Saturday to talk about fermented food?
        <div class="next">Fermentation can ...
        <ul>
            <li class="next">make food more nutritious, even disease-fighting</li>
            <li class="next">preserve food easily</li>
            <li class="next">make food taste better.</li>
            <li class="next">make new kinds of food. Many common foods were originally fermented.</li>

        <h2>The process of fermentation</h2>
        Fermentation means micro-organisms are consuming or transforming one
        thing into another. To ferment, you need three things:
        <ul>
            <li class="next">Something to ferment. Milk, cabbage, flour, meat, others.</li>
            <li class="next">A micro-organism. These come from the air, or from a <b>starter</b>, which might simply be a bit of leftover from the last batch.</li>
            <li class="next">The proper environment. This means the proper temperature, salinity, pH, oxygen availability, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sourdough</h2>
        Sourdough is easy. Mix flour with water. Wait.
        <ul>
            <li>Use the same kind of flour all the time</li>
            <li>Feed it regularly</li>
            <li>Use non-chlorinated water where possible</li>
            <li>Keep it warm</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Lacto-Fermentation</h2>
        Some bacteria produce <b>lactic acid</b>, which is an excellent
        preservative. These are called <b>lactobacilli</b>. They're found
        everywhere, but are especially common in raw milk and yogurt, and are
        used to ferment pickles, sauerkraut, and many other vegetables. They're
        more salt tolerant than many <b>putrefying</b> bacteria.

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>Fermenting Vegetables</h2>
        <p>The basic process for most vegetables is to clean them, mash them into
        a jar, add salt and any necessary water, and optionally, whey. Let it
        sit a while, and transfer to cool, dark storage.</p>
        <p>This works for beets, cabbage, beans, kale, carrots, peppers, garlic,
        and many others. Softer vegetables are more difficult.</p>

        <h2>It fermented. Now what?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Trust your senses. Food that looks or smells bad probably is.</li>
            <li>Try a little, and pay attention. If it burns or makes you dizzy, stop eating.</li>
            <li>Spots of low-growing white mold are called <b>Kahm yeast</b>, and are generally not a problem.</li>

    <section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep things clean. This is more important the longer you'll be storing an item.</li>
            <li>Use non-chlorinated water. Chlorine is there to kill fermenting organisms.</li>
            <li>Use the right amount of salt.</li>
            <li>Use whey with more sugary ferments. It may make your results mushy.</li>
            <li>Keep ferments separate, or they'll cross-contaminate.</li>
            <li>Finding a reliable source of raw milk will change your life.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The next level</h2>
        Fermented beverages are some of our favorites. They have similar health
        benefits, and can replace many unhealthy habits. These include
        <b>kefir</b>, <b>ginger ale</b>, and <b>kombucha</b>.
	</div></section>
    <section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>Kombucha</h2>
        <p>Originally from Russia, kombucha is a fermented, sweetened tea. The
        fermentation removes much of the caffeine, carbonates and acidulates
        the liquid, and produces several beneficial compounds.</p>
        <p>Black tea with refined sugar works best; herbal teas can slow or
        stop the fermentation, and less refined sugars contribute off-flavors.</p>
