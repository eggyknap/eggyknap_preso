% Untangling Federal Jurisdiction

% Order:
% Fundamental principles
% Two forces is a fundamental principle
% Fabians are one side of the contending force
% Tree party is another side (or something else we know more about)
% Fabian side tends to win (tree party changes recently, fasces)
% Washington hated kings, yet here he is with fasces, added later
% Thebans are another example
% Religious freedom is in the news lately

must lie in the frequent recurrence to \emph{first principles}, and
the imposition of adequate constitutional restrictions.''}

% Include "Uncle Eric" series. We need a handout with references, and that can go on there.

% XXX Notes on Jefferson bible, to counter "deists don't want Christ" stuff. Stuff from Franklin, as well, who liked scripture even if he was atheistish

expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of
conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those
sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced
\textbf{he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties}.''}
% XXX Nail what Jefferson means by social duties. It's not "social justice". Does Jefferson tell us we have a social duty to make sure everyone's treated fairly, for instance?
