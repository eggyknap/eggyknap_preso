% Order:
% Fundamental principles
% Two forces is a fundamental principle
% Fabians are one side of the contending force
% Tree party is another side (or something else we know more about)
% Fabian side tends to win (tree party changes recently, fasces)
% Washington hated kings, yet here he is with fasces, added later
% Thebans are another example
% Religious freedom is in the news lately
