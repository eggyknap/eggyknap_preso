* Start with Arminius, to demonstrate the lengths people are willing to go to, to preserve Natural Law. Or even, start with Moses as an introductory exampe
* Demonstrate the fasces as symbols of the contending forces
* Trace the roots of natural law and later perversion by Roman law principles, in each of the members of the clause family
