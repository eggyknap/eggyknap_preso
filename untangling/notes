Collect stories of history's traitors -- Decl. of Independence signers, scriptural rabble rousers, etc.
    * Per Steve Millet, the ideas of the declaration started ten years beforehand.
    * Include modern rebels, too -- ones that aren't necessarily appreciated. Perhaps compare various modern and ancient rebels
        * Princess Leia? :)
    * Compare to our country. Everyone likes to think that it's ok for others to rebel, because their situation is so much worse than our own.
    * Include the Estonian partisan story, perhaps
    * Native American rebels?

Basic Constitutional history -- perhaps people know it already, and perhaps they don't. Find out.
    * Include interpretations of "habeas corpus", "bill of attainder", etc.
    * What are the amendments? What's their history?

"You have a responsibility to this country" -- and to freedom
"You need to stand up for what you believe in" -- and know what you believe in.

Challeneged us to run for office. Interesting.

Are there things that happened in premortal life that I need to be able to remember?

Write a pamphlet on speaking technique.
    * Stance
    * Motion
    * Pronunciation
    * Tone / expression
    * Content and organization (signposting)
    * Slides
        * They should have some content
        * They should be visible
            * Steve's presentation has lovely pictures, but they have lots of
              brightness range, and it's hard to find text colors, etc. that
              will show up nicely over all of it.
        * Spellcheck has its limitations ("Protection of Piers")
    * Audience participation
    * Timing
    * Energy!!1

How was it supposed to work out for states that didn't ratify the Constitution?
    Would they still be bound by it? If they're a sovereign state, on what
    grounds is that binding legal?

What were the two unratified amendments in the Bill of Rights?

Learn about religious liberty. Might be a decent presentation.
    * Pilgrims, Mormons, other early American white settlers. Find examples of specific events where lack of religious liberty was a major factor.
    * Mention pastors prior to Lexington Green

H.L. Tolley, Masonic master in the 50's sometime, or thereabouts, in Milford.

Jon notes:
----------
    * Good energy getting started. And much needed.
    * Hands in pockets? Erg... I guess it is flipping cold.
    * "Embollized" (e.g. represented by an emblem) means something entirely different
    * You're making these presentations your own That's very helpful, especially since this presentation jumps around even more than the original

"Fill yourself up with knowledge, and teach from the overflow." -- Stephen Pratt, quoted by Glenn Stoneman

At some point I need to read Heller
Apparently only 2% of the population were involved in the Revolutionary War.



Duchesne Notes
==============

! Breathing may actually be a problem. I wonder what would help get it going nicely in advance...
    - As evidenced by occasional tendencies to stop and take a deep breath
* Better fonts, for use with the projector.
* Better pictures. These ones suck.
+ Excellent job emphasizing why a "trustworthy" Supreme Court is important
+ Also a good job talking about why Phyllis Schlafly and Mark Levin are important
* Crop Levin and Schlafly's book images
* Cleveland's portrait on the first applicable slide ought to have his sheriff's star on
! Cleveland was the 22nd and 24th president
* Consider framing the Roman empire map
+ Good job getting into the Teutoberg story
* Yeah, the title font sucks, on the projector. Perhaps that's the fault of the computer?
* Make the Obama brass fasces image larger -- crop it, so there's less magazine
* The fasces overlay on the Obama picture is awful
* I need to make sure Jon feels comfortable with how the slides respond to him. He shouldn't feel bound by not knowing how they work
* I also need to pay attention to timing.
* Denkmal may be spelled wrong (Hermannsdenkmal, per Wikipedia)
... Two greatest mortal rules (keep your promises, don't encroach on others or their property) may have a relationship to Love thy God; love they neighbor as thyself.
? Would it be better to have the quotes at the top of the page? You can more easily see the top of the screen, than the bottom
* Moses and Jethro should be a bigger picture
* Slides that change gradually shouldn't have bits moving around between slide
* "Simple Republic" slide is still ugly
* Can the clause family be made less repetetive? Better looking?
    - Interesting that "Necessary and Proper" doesn't show up here
* Rotate Mack / Printz picture so it's straight
* Clip around Daniel Webster's oval image
* Smooth the border between the pictures in the background image with a gray line
* Find Upshur's book, and add something about it
! Test various projectors with the slides, to see which works best
    - The background image on this one kinda sucks. Label the projectors so we can tell the difference. #1 should be the best.
* Walter Neal*E* ?
* Background color for colorboxen ought to be non-white
! Sorry, I didn't un-comment the federal fish
* Perhaps I should distinguish between supreme court and lower court decisions (like US v. Gardner, which apparently didn't go to the supreme court)
... I'm unconvinced that having more land for inhabitants means we'd have more inhabitants for representing. I need to think about it some.
+ Maestoso reading of various people is definitely not overdoing it.
* Use of \large, \huge, etc. is inconsistent, and ugly (font change may help)
* "We should have a bigger red light" just after the enclave / nat'l park slide
* You're running out of energy (when we get to G. Morris, duplicity)
    - My messing up the Kohl / Leavenworth slides didn't help
! It still seems we talk about Kleppe a lot before introducing it
* Sliding scale might look nicer if the down lines were big arrows, definitively overwriting previous cases' names
* The background image isn't big enough to get to the bottom of the screen
! The beginning was excellent; after the break, things slowed down some
* When it's big, the kid picture kinda sucks
* Better looking clause family strike-out
* Can the virginia resolution slide's highlighted words have a background color, instead of a text color?
* Benny House picture is bad. Brad Rogers, too
* Check out the socialism images. They need help. Perhaps emphasize ACORN image on minimum wage.
* "Tell us where you are and we'll send you money" needs to be lots better
* Study income tax necessity vs. federal banking
* Is there a good way to help the Yreka lawyer lady and document more cases of the fed gov paying environmentalists to sue the feds
* Consider bordering the quote boxes with some small line to help contrast (but if we're changing colors, perhaps that doesn't matter)
* Nationalists / States' rights page should look better. Minipages?
* Can latex do a smoother job of enlarging images?

(From earlier, therefore perhaps no longer applicable)
Possible restructuring:

* Start with Arminius, to demonstrate the lengths people are willing to go to, to preserve Natural Law. Or even, start with Moses as an introductory exampe
* Demonstrate the fasces as symbols of the contending forces
* Trace the roots of natural law and later perversion by Roman law principles, in each of the members of the clause family
