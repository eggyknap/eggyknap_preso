Why would I want to be licensed
    Neat stuff radio can do
        * Family and friend communications
            * QRP around the world
            * Longwave, WSPR et al.
        * Emergency preparedness
        * Alternative news and information sources
        * Radio control
        * Homebrew radar
        * Wireless networking
        * Aircraft and rocket telemetry
        * EME, satellite
    You've gotta be licensed to do much of this, legally
Where does open source get involved?
    * homebrew
    * digital modes
    * sdr (gnuradio)
