\title{A PostgreSQL Overview}
\author{Joshua Tolley -- eggyknap -- End Point Corporation}

% outline:
% introductory blabber
% start with initdb
% - introduce "cluster"
% - Everything lives in this directory (unless you make it more complicated)
% - pg_ctl controls this
% psql
% - Each connection starts a new process. Use a connection pooler
% - pg_get_backend_pid()
% - There's also pgadmin (screenshot?)
% Create schemas and views, do some permissions magic
% - Perhaps just show off bits of TriSano
% Show a complex query (bucardo_rate, perhaps?)
% Describe MVCC, and how a transaction actually works
% - locking, at least. Perhaps kill a session mid-transaction
% - Might as well talk about vacuum and what it is, since folks have heard of it
% --=< More complex stuff >=--
% Replication
% - Talk about async vs. sync, various available options
% - PITR, hot standby, streaming replication, synchronous replication
% Query planning
% - Mention different join algorithms. Query planner is really complex
% Functions
% - All kinds of PLs, including C
% - Contrib
% - PostGIS (mention some of the bits it's built from)
% Text search
% Window functions
% CTEs
% - Incl. recursion. Mandelbrot example
