I'd like to start by illustrating a transaction in a way that will make it
easier for us to be sure we're talking about the same thing. It's a classic
example, and you have all heard it before, so I'll cover it only quickly, but
I think it will provide useful background for further discussion.

Alice and Bob are both customers at Podunk Bank and Trust. Alice owes Bob $25
for a basket she bought from Bob's underwater basketweaving business, so she
gives Bob a check issued by Podunk Bank and Trust. Bob endorses the check and
hands it to the teller, and now it's up to the bank to process it. They need
to debit Alice $25, and credit Bob the same amount, and in the simplest
implementation, they simply do just that, and all is well. But what happens if
the server crashes after they've debited Alice but before they've credited
Bob? You might say this is unlikely, but when Podunk Bank and Trust grows to
60K customers it suddenly becomes much more likely that a server crash will
interrupt at least one such operation. And unless the application has very
good logging, there will be no way to tell that Alice was debited but Bob
wasn't credited.
