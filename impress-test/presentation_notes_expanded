* On Sunday we talked about the accepted wisdom that a speaker should keep his
  hands at his sides. I figured it wasn't that important for a small group, but
  as it turns out, I was wrong. You tend to hold them clasped in front, and I
  felt it detracted somewhat (though I was probably the only one that noticed).

* Speakers recommend "signposting" at the beginning of their talks, which is
  where you say "first I'll talk about this, followed by this and this." You
  did this naturally, and it was a very good thing.

* The word is "Recurrence", not "ReOcurrence"

* The "decimate" example is a good one, to describe words whose exact meaning
  we generally ignore.

* There are a few "filler" phrases you tend to say habitually. The most
  noticeable was "you know". This will go away naturally as your comfort with
  the presentation increases, but it helps to work on it consciously, too.

* Referring to whichever justice it was (Ginsburg?) as "this lady" is probably
  not so great. "This gentleman" is better, but not so great.

* I think it would help to explain more clearly why overturning Supreme Court
* decisions "by the bushel basket" is bad

* Your presentation of the Tim Lewis, Phyllis Schafly, etc. slides consisted
  mostly of "here's another very competent person". If you have time to develop
  more info on one or all of them, it would help.

* It would be cool to have a slide showing the veto count for various
  presidents, to see how extreme Grover Cleveland was. His slide should include
  the dates of his terms of office (per Wikipedia, March 4, 1885 – March 4,
  1889, March 4, 1893 – March 4, 1897)

* Good job asking the audience what "fundamental principles" means. Please
  define "recurrence".

* I like the Mark Twain quote about history rhyming a lot

* Work on your introduction and initial description of the fasces.

* Learn to pronounce Teutoburg :)

* The Shire Reef slide seemed to throw you off. I'd recommend working out a
  30-second description of it, and practicing it once or twice.

* Some of the details of how the Utah territory was downsized would be
  interesting, but you probably don't have time to dig 'em up.

* I'd work on your delivery of the story of the Utah Enabling Act. You seemed
  to be just reading the slides, and there it's important to know what happened
  in detail.

* Consistent use of the term "War Between the States" Nice! :)

* The jurisdiction clause family slide could use a canned introduction, too.
  The slide can be pretty dramatic, but your introduction of it was rough. I'd
  perhaps start with something like this: "The Constitution contain a family of
  frequently abused clauses..."

* More backstory on Mack / Printz would be nice.

* More pronunciation: Antonin (as in Scalia)

* The fasces slide just after the "Famous Nationalists" suggests that the
  various characteristics of Roman Law are inseparable... e.g that "National
  Soverignty" can't be separated from "tax and control everything"

* Your description of Joseph Story included some cool details, but didn't
  include that he was a Supreme Court justice, nor that he wrote a book that
  was pretty much *the* basis of Constitutional law and thought for a century.

* I'll try to get a picture of the Lincoln Memorial, showing its temple-like
  nature more, or perhaps one with a more detailed view of the fasces.

* The "America's Caesar" book needs some introduction

* Around the time of the anti-federalist slide you started just reading the
  slides

* The "All Laws" slide toward the end looks awfully nice :)

The end seeemd to come as a surprise to you.
