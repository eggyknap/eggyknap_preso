* Fig leaf. Turns out it's not all that great even in a small group
* Signposts naturally... w00t :)
* The word is "Recurrence", not "reocurrence"
* The decimate example is a good one. Decent story. For the sheriffs, perhaps
  talking about "democracy"'s connotation disparagingly isn't great
* "you know"
* Referring to ... whichever justice it is ... as "this lady" is probably not
  so great. "This gentleman" is better, but not so great.
* Let's explain more clearly why overturning Supreme Court decisions "by the
  bushel basket" is bad
* The Tim Lewis, Phyllis Schafly, etc. slides need to be presented better.
  "here's another very competent person"
* Get veto records for various presidents to share along with the Grover
  Cleveland stuff. Also add the dates of his presidencies.
* Good job asking the audience what "fundamental principles" means. Please
  define "recurrence", and don't say it "reoccurence" :)
* I like the Mark Twain quote about history rhyming a lot
* Introduction of the fasces was lousy.
* Learn to pronounce Teutoburg
* The Shire Reef picture slide obviously threw you off. So did the territory of
  Utah slide. Your dad's intro was better.
* Some of the details of the downsizing of the Utah territory would be
  interesting
* Describe what the Utah Enabling Act is. It's the law that establishes Utah as
  a state.
* All the slides around here seem to be a bit unfamiliar, unless you're
  reminded of a story
* w.r.t. contracts, the major goal is to determine how one party leaves the
  contract, because one day one party will have to leave.
* Utah wouldn't accept public schools? Neat :) Expand.
* Consistent use of the term "War Between the States" Nice! :)
* Describe the jurisdiction clause family. "The Constitution contain a family
  of frequently abused clauses..."
* The Utah constitution / codes that define the sheriff slide was rough
* More backstory on Mack / Printz would be nice.
* Also learn to pronounce "Antonin" (e.g. Scalia)
* You essentially skipped the slide just before Hamilton.
* The fasces slide just after the "Famous Nationalists" suggests that the
  various characteristics of Roman Law are inseparable... e.g that "National
  Soverignty" can't be separated from "tax and control everything"
* Good job introducing Joseph Story. Wasn't he a law guy, too, though?
* Get a picture of the Lincoln Memorial, and perhaps an easier one for seeing
  the fasces
* The "America's Caesar" book needs some introduction
* The dime's fasces *does* show the staff in the middle of the bundle of sticks
* I ought to read St. George Tucker, and the Anti-Federalist Papers, and
  Upshur's book
* Around the time of the anti-federalist slide you started just reading the
  slides
* "If I remember right" for Walter Neal. Get the memory straight?
* The "A coordinating mechanism" slide was just read out. :(
* Note to self: impress.js doesn't offer the possibility of seeing notes on
  upcoming slides.
* The "All Laws" slide looks awfully nice :)

The end came as a surprise to you.

"Presentation is terrific" .oO(Would Sparky say differently?)
